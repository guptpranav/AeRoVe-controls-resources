# AeRoVe Controls Subsystem Training

## PHASE 1: INTRODUCTION

1. Introductory Control Theory: (1 week)
   - [Understanding PID Control - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn8PRpmsu08pQBgjxYFXSsODEF3Jqmm-y)
   - [Introduction to State Space](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn8PRpmsu08podBgFw66-IavqU2SqPg_w)
2. [Udacity Flying Car](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ClqLDvT_UyG1Rd4DArQm-XUh2EkyofOr?usp=share_link): Download this folder and open any HTML file inside using Chrome, then you can navigate through the course on Chrome itself. Start with Part 3: Controls (till lesson 4) While going through the course, you will also be required to attempt some coding assignments on the relevant topics. The assignments are Jupyter notebooks and can be found on this repository itself. Attempting the assignments as they come along in the course is a must. Here is the [link to the assignments](https://github.com/Team-AeRoVe-UMIC/Training-Modules/tree/Controls)
3. [Coursera Aerial Robotics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-flight): sign up on Coursera and apply for financial aid; audit the course in the meanwhile and complete the assignments as soon as financial aid is approved. (1 week)
4. **MATLAB** + **Simulink** training (1 week)
   - MATLAB and Simulink Onramp
   - [MATLAB Crash Course for Beginners - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f50sQYjNRA)
   - [Simulink Basics - A Practical Look - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIAxyLchf4k)
   - [Getting Started with Simulink, Part 1: How to Build and Simulate a Simple Simulink Model - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOmqgewj5XI)
   - [Getting Started with Simulink | Tips and Tricks to Get the Most Out of Simulink - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu4M3dD0kPQ) (optional)
5. Trajectory Generation: Minimum Snap + Polynomial (research papers) - The next part of your training requires you to go through two papers on trajectory generation. One of them is one of the most famous works on minimum snap trajectory generation by Vijay Kumar (same guy from the Coursera course). Read this paper in detail and mark down important points. The next paper is an extension of the above paper. The initial part of this paper will help you understand the problem in a better way. Read this paper in detail up to the 9th page. Both papers can be found in this [drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10p5J0xBnXCmS1YHs4VmpubQ_DiW77DC8). Some useful links that will help you understand the process better: <https://www.programmersought.com/article/42126902708/> and <https://www.programmersought.com/article/79683831846/> (1.5 weeks)
6. detailed quadrotor dynamics report and presentation (.5 weeks)

## PHASE 2: INTERMEDIATE

1. MAVROS + SITL training: [mavros - ROS Wiki](https://wiki.ros.org/mavros)
2. write your own MAVROS GNC API
3. hardware familiarisation training
4. eigen3 + LQR simulation: [walkthrough link](https://aleksandarhaber.com/implementation-of-the-solution-of-the-linear-quadratic-regulator-lqr-control-algorithm-in-c-by-using-the-eigen-matrix-library/) - In this control engineering, control theory, computer science, and scientific computing tutorial we explain how to implement a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control algorithm in C++ from scratch by using the Eigen matrix library. To implement the algorithm, we use the Newton method for solving the underlying Riccati equation. You will learn how to write a C++ class that will in a disciplined and object-oriented manner implement the solution of the LQR control algorithm. Also, you will learn how to write a driver code for using this class.
5. MAVROS assignment: (TBD)

## PHASE 3: ADVANCED

1. [VNAV (MIT OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/16-485-visual-navigation-for-autonomous-vehicles-vnav-fall-2020/pages/lecture-notes/): this will be a revision of what you have learned in the previous courses and includes some trajectory optimization material.
2. Ardupilot + PX4 source code + PX4 documentation
3. write full controller upto body rates
   - [Drone Simulation and Control - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy8TVa88QVfoOotVLloGWvK6PMSdjEtSb)
   - [ArduCopter Documentation](https://ardupilot.org/copter/index.html)
   - [PX4 documentation](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/)
4. State Estimation: [Understanding Sensor Fusion and Tracking](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn8PRpmsu08ryYoBpEKzoMOveSTyS-h4a)
